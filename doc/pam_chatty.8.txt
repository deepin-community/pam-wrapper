NAME
----

pam_chatty - A PAM test module that generates PAM info and error messages.

SYNOPSIS
--------
pam_chatty.so [...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *pam_chatty* module makes it easy to replicate the behaviour of PAM
modules that generate a lot of output, in order to ensure that PAM clients
react as expected.

IMPORTANT
---------
pam_chatty is a *test tool*. It should be considered completely insecure
and never used outside test environments! As you'll see when reading
description of the options, many of them don't make any sense
in the real world and were added just to make tests possible.

The pam_chatty module generates a lot of PAM info and error output, when
its authentication method is called, and then returns success.

OPTIONS
-------
* *num_lines=NUMBER* - the number of lines of messages to output, for each
one of the enabled types of messages selected.

* *error* - whether to output error level messages.

* *info* - whether to output info level messages.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
---------------------
Only the *auth* module type is supported.

EXAMPLE
-------
[source,bash]
auth            required        pam_chatty.so num_lines=16 info error
